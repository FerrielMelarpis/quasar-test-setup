# Quasar Test Setup

> This is a HowTo repository for setting up unit test and e2e test in Quasar Framework.

Like most of you, I have been frustrated with setting up test environments in Quasar.
Although the Vue JS community has put a lot of effort in making [project templates](https://github.com/vuejs-templates),
it is not quite easy to just copy the test configuration and import in a quasar project.
Quasar Framework is a handy framework for frontend development and it is pretty robust
when it comes to commonly used [components](http://quasar-framework.org/components).
And of course, for some of us that wants quality to be assured, test setup is necessary.

## Setting Up

Read the [docs](docs/). All the steps are in there. 
Feel free to file an issue or create a PR for enhancements and fixes.
